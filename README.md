# cesium-app
A little test web-app to get CesiumJS up and working

This is a React-based app that has a single component with a Cesium 3D renderer.

You will need an Access Token from Cesium Ion to be able to access the libraries. This must be added to your `./key` directory as a file called `access-token.key`
